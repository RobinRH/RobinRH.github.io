<p>You want to catch an eruption of Steamboat Geyser. You have a list of eruption times for Steamboat. You can calculate the following statistics about eruption times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average calendar days between eruptions: Average number of calendar days between eruption dates. Ignore the hours and minutes. For example, suppose the first eruption is July 15, 2020, 10:15 AM and the second is July 17, 2020, 1:10 PM, then the number of calendar days between eruptions is 2.</li>
<li>Average hour: The average hour that an eruption occurs. Ignore the day and minutes.</li>
<li>Median minutes: The median minute that an eruption occurs. Ignore the day and hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Round down all averages to an integer.</p>
<p>The most recent eruption is the last eruption in the intput file. To create your prediction from the most recent eruption:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date: Add the average calendar days between eruptions to the previous eruption date.</li>
<li>Hour: Set to the average hour of eruption.</li>
<li>Minutes: Set to the median minute of eruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the test input, the statistics are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Statistic</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Average days</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Average hour</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Median minutes</td>
<td>31</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The last eruption in the test file is 2019-09-03 07:25:00. The solution, in the form mm:dd:yyyy:hh:mm, is 09:06:2019:09:31.</p>
<pre>
What is your prediction for the next eruption? Give your answer in the form mm:dd:yyyy:hh:mm, using a 24-hour clock.
