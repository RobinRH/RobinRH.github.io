# Yellowstone Codera

Yellowstone Codera is 14 days of Python puzzles inspired by Yellowstone National Park. Each puzzle highlights a different Python programming technique or library, though you don't have to use Python to solve the puzzles. Most of the solutions have fewer than 30 lines of code. 

+ I will update this homepage each day with a new link to a new puzzle.
+ When you enter the correct answer for a puzzle, the badge appears on the map.
+ Answers are case-sensitive.
+ Your answers are stored in local storage, so that when you update the page, your previous answers still appear. There is a link to delete all the local storage values on the homepage.

Each puzzle contains a few files:

+ story: Describes the puzzle.
+ input: The input for the puzzle. (Not all puzzles have a separate input file.)
+ test: A second input file for the puzzle that you can use to check your solution. (Not all puzzles have a separate test file.)
+ hints: Links to libraries and functions that might help you solve the puzzle. The hints file does not have algorithmic hints.

I will post solutions to all the problems on the 15th day.
