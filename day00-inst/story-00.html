<h1 id="yellowstone-codera">Yellowstone Codera</h1>
<p>Yellowstone Codera is 14 days of Python puzzles inspired by Yellowstone National Park. Each puzzle highlights a different Python programming technique or library, though you don’t have to use Python to solve the puzzles. Most of the solutions have fewer than 30 lines of code.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will update this homepage each day with a new link to a new puzzle.</li>
<li>When you enter the correct answer for a puzzle, the badge appears on the map.</li>
<li>Answers are case-sensitive.</li>
<li>Your answers are stored in local storage, so that when you update the page, your previous answers still appear. There is a link to delete all the local storage values on the homepage.</li>
<li>The homepage was tested on Chrome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each puzzle contains a few files:</p>
<ul>

<li>test: A second input file for the puzzle that you can use to check your solution. (Not all puzzles have a separate test file.)</li>
<li>hints: Links to libraries and functions that might help you solve the puzzle. The hints file does not have algorithmic hints.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will post solutions to all the problems on the 15th day.</p>
