<p>Due to overcrowding, the National Park Service runs a lottery of sorts to enter the park. The lottery is based on several conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>license plate number (AZ - Arizona, CA - California, ID - Idaho, MT - Montana, NM - New Mexico, NV - Nevada, OR - Oregon, UT - Utah, WA - Washington)</li>
<li>license plate state</li>
<li>order in line</li>
<li>has annual pass</li>
</ul>
<p>On the day that you enter the park, the cars are allowed in in the following order during the first hour:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All cars from Utah.</li>
<li>All cars with an annual pass.</li>
<li>License plates that start with “Y”.</li>
<li>Move the first 47 cars to the end of the line.</li>
<li>Every tenth car. Number the cars starting at 1. Let in cars number 10, 20, 30, etc.</li>
<li>License plates that start with “P”.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are 200 cars in the test input file. The numbers of cars left in line after each step are 179, 86, 83, 83, 75, and 70.</p>
<pre>
At the end of the hour, how many cars are still in line?
