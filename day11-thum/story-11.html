<p>Yellowstone biologists are diligently working to restore the native cutthroat trout and remove the invasive lake trout from Lake Yellowstone. As part of that effort, they are training a group of Citizen Scientists to recognize the cutthroat trout. To keep is simple and quick, the Citizen Scientists will only consider two characteristics of the fish. Native cuttthroat trout have spots (not bars) and a red jaw splash (not another color). These two characteristics correctly classify most of the fish, but not all.</p>
<p>The Citizen Scientists were given 1000 fish to classify as either cutthroat or not. For each fish, the input file contains the ID, the species (determined separately by the biologists), the marking and the color of the jaw splash. A fish is classified as a cutthroat if it has a red jaw splash and is spotted. Otherwise, the fish is classified as not cutthroat.</p>
<p>This table show the results from the test data.</p>

<p>A false negative is a cutthroat that is classified as not a cutthroat. The test input has 3 false negatives.</p>
<pre>
How many false negatives are there in the 1000 fish that the Citizen Scientists classified?
