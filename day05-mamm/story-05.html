<h1 id="day-5---mammoth">Day 5 - Mammoth</h1>
<p>Mammoth is one of the warmer areas of the park, generally running 10 degress warmer than the Old Faithful area. Not unexpectedly, it is 90 degress when you arrive at high noon. Despite the line, you decide to get an ice cream treat at the soda fountain. The menu looks complicated, but it turns out that you can reduce it to a few options and rules. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Options:
<ul>
<li>Treat: Single cone, double cone, sundae.</li>
<li>Ice cream flavor: Chocolate, strawberry, vanilla, rocky road, huckleberry, orange sherbet.</li>
<li>Topping: Hot fudge, caramel, pineapple, sprinkles.</li>
<li>Cherry: Yes or no.</li>
<li>Whipped cream: Yes or no.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rules:
<ul>
<li>All treats have a topping.</li>
<li>A single cone can’t have whipped cream or a cherry.</li>
<li>Chocolate ice cream can’t have pineapple topping.</li>
<li>A sundae has to have whipped cream and a cherry.</li>
<li>Orange sherbet can’t have hot fudge topping.</li>
<li>Double cones must have two different ice cream flavors.</li>
<li>Single cones and sundaes have one ice cream flavor.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
