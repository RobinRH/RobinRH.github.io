<p>You arrive at Fountain Paintpots only to learn that you just missed a simultaneous eruption of Fountain, Morning, Morningâ€™s Thief, Jet, Frying Pan, Kaliedoscope, and several other geysers.</p>
<p>While eruptions are not predictable in the basin, a simultaneous eruption is (somewhat) predicable. Each geyser has a period and duration. The simultaneous eruption occurs when, for every geyser, the number of minutes from the previous simultaneous eruption, divided by the period has a remainder of the duration.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have this input, and the last eruption was midnight May 1st:</p>
<pre>
geyser,period,duration
Fountain,444,9
Morning,375,51
</pre>
<p>The number of minutes is 41301:</p>

<p>41301 minutes after midnight May 1st is 05:29:16:21, in mm:dd:hh:mm format (month:day:hour:minute using a 24-hour clock).</p>
<pre>
You missed the eruption at midnight of June 1st. 
When it the next simultaneous eruption? Give the answer as mm:dd:hh:mm, using a 24-hour clock.
